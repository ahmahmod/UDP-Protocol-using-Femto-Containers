# UDP Protocol using Femto Containers
Implementing the UDP Protocol on IoT devices using Femto Containers virtualization technique.

## Introduction
This repository contains the source codes and results of the paper entitled "*Programmable Solutions for Low-power Lossy Wireless Networks: A Study of SDN and Femto Containers*," which is going to be published soon (a link will be provided when available).

## Directories
- **RIOT**: Contains the fork of the RIOT source tree used for the measurements.
- **femto-containers**: Contains the fork of the Femto Containers source tree used for the measurements.
- **UDP_GNRC**: Contains the source code to run the native UDP protocol of the GNRC Stack.
- **UDP_hook_static**: Contains the source code to run the UDP protocol in Femto Containers using static memory for packet buffering.

## How to Run
Each use case has its own README file with instructions on how to run it.
